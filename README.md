# RatingPredictor
 

When we start Competitive Programming, we often struggle with how to practice effectively in order to reach a rating of $X$ on the renowned competitive programming platform Codeforces. This paper introduces a new Machine Learning Model that can help programmers to know how to practice to reach their desired rating. In this model, we analyzed the submissions of around $25000$ Codeforces users to see how they practiced before reaching to rating $X$ and then trained a ML Model by the submissions and rating of the users so that we can predict the rating for a specific range of solved problems. 
In conclusion, this model help any user to determine which range of problems to practice in order to achieve rating $X$.
